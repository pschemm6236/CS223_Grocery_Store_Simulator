This program is simple to run. There are 5 integer values that the user must enter and then the program simulation 
automatically runs after the fifth value is entered. A user must enter the time values, in order, for the minimum 
arrival, maximum arrival, minimum service, and maximum service for the customers the program is going to simulate. 
After the user enters the number of customers they want to run the program with time values and checkout line statuses
will print along the screen, simulating customers entering the store, getting in line, getting serviced, and then
leaving. After the simulation is done serving all the customers, the average wait time, total time checkouts were not 
being used, number of satisfied and dissatisfied customers, and a table summarizing the whole simulation are all 
displayed. 

Lastly, at the top of the console output for the beginning of the program, a batch of recommended settings 
are displayed to the user. These are merely recommendations and the settings were used to best simulate customers
entering and leaving the queues.
